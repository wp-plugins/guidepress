**GuidePress is currently in BETA. Please [contact us](http://guidepress.net/contact/ "contact us") if you find any bugs**


The GuidePress plugin delivers WordPress video tutorials straight into the WordPress Dashboard. It's perfect if you're new to WordPress or if you're a developer who wants to use it as a training guide for your clients (which will save you a lot of time and let your clients learn at their own pace).

You'll need a subscription to use this plugin. By default we give you a free subscription when you create a [free GuidePress account](http://guidepress.net/wp-login.php?action=register "GuidePress Registration Screen"). We also offer a [Premium subscription](http://guidepress.net/pricing/ "GuidePress Premium Subscription"). 

**Note:** At the moment we have only published a small number of video tutorials. But we will be adding lots more in the coming weeks. 


Main features include:

* Watch video tutorials without leaving the WordPress dashboard. 
* Videos are discretely placed inside a "video tutorials" dropdown tab. 
* New video tutorials are added every week.
* Videos are categorised into beginner, intermediate, and advanced level.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Who is this plugin for =

GuidePress is the perfect companion for people new to WordPress. However if you are a WordPress developer then you can give GuidePress to your client and they can learn how to use WordPress at their own pace.  

= Why do I need to create a GuidePress.net account =

Our video library feed is stored on GuidePress.net. The GuidePress plugin needs to log into GuidePress.net in order to pull the video library feed.  

= Why isn't the video feed hard coded into the GuidePress plugin =

We are constantly adding new video tutorials to our library, sometimes daily. That's why it's more practical to separate out the feed so that it can be regularly updated. The GuidePress plugin will automatically pull the latest feed about once a week. This will occur in the background and you won't even notice it happening.   

= Can I manually update the feed =

Yes, you can do this by going to the GuidePress settings screen. Please follow us on twitter at @GuidePress_WP if you want to keep up to date with the latest video tutorials. 

= Why are there only a small number of video tutorials =

GuidePress is quite a new plugin and that's why we're a little short on videos. However we are ramping our efforts to release more videos quickly. We'll also keep our videos up to date with future releases of WordPress. 

= Are the video tutorials available without the GuidePress.net branding =

Yes, they are available if you sign up to our premium subscription.
